# futsal-team-maker
At Daytona Technologies, we love to play soccer. We organise matches twice a week. For each session, we try to randomise the teams fairly so that we have two well-balanced teams with players of different ratings.  We assign a rating to each player (1, 3, 5, 6, 8) 1 - irregular ball control and shooting 3 - decent ball control and field vision. 5 - good ball control and good shot 6 - good play maker 8 - our local messi / ronaldo  Write a software that allows a user to create two relatively balanced teams of 5 players each chosen from a pool of players (letâ€™s say 25).  Each player will have a specific rating assigned to them - futsalIndex.  Test cases are mandatory.
